        <h2>Welcome to the Inner Workings of my Mind</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! These are some of the projects I've been working on during my time at Lambda School as well as a few side projects. I'm always adding new projects so check back often to see how I'm progressing with my web development skills. Take a look around and let me know what you think!</p>

               These are the projects I've created at Lambda School in the first week. We've learned HTML and CSS basics as well as git. So far we've built on the fundamentals using flexbox.
